# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
#20.times do |i| 
 #   Student.create(first_name: "Ravi #{i+1}", last_name: "singh #{i+1}", age_of_student: 22, )
#end
#Student.all.each do |i|
 #   i.blogs.create(title: "Dummy Blog for Student #{i.id}", content: "custom content pending")
#
 #   i.blogs.create(title: "Dummy Blog for Student #{i.id}", content: "custom content pending")
